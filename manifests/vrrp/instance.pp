#                          Default: undef.
#
# $unicast_source_ip::     default IP for binding vrrpd is the primary IP
#                          on interface. If you want to hide the location of vrrpd,
#                          use this IP as src_addr for unicast vrrp packets.
#                          Default: undef. 
#
# $unicast_peers::         Do not send VRRP adverts over VRRP multicast group.
#                          Instead send adverts to the list of ip addresses using 
#                          a unicast design fashion.
#
#                          May be specified as an array with ip addresses
#                          Default: undef.
#
# $dont_track_primary      Tells keepalived to ignore VRRP interface faults.
#                          Can be useful on setup where two routers are
#                          connected directly to each other on the interface
#                          used for VRRP. Without this feature the link down
#                          caused by one router crashing would also inspire
#                          the other router to lose (or not gain) MASTER state,
#                          since it was also tracking link status.
#                          Default: false.
